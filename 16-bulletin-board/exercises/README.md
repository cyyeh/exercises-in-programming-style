# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Words with z. Change the given example program so that it implements an additional task: after printing out the list of 25 top words, it should print out the number of non-stop words with the letter z. Additional constraints: (i) no changes should be made to the existing classes; adding new classes and more lines of code to the main function is allowed; (ii) files should be read only once for both term frequency and “words with z” tasks.
3. Unsubscribe. Pub-sub architectures usually also support the concept of unsubscribing from event types. Change the example program so that EventManager supports the operation unsubscribe. Make the components unsubscribe from event types at appropriate times. Show that your unsubscription mechanism works correctly.
4. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using this style.
