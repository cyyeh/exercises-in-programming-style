# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another array programming language, such as MATLAB or Julia.
2. Stay in style. In line #33, followed by line #37, we broke from the array programming style to construct a list of words from the array of characters, and then create an array of strings from those words. Reimplement the second part of the program (from line #28 onward) without breaking from the array programming style. That is, work on an array of words expressed as a 2D array of characters.
3. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using the array programming style.
