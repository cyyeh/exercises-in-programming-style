# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Words with z. Change the given example program so that it implements an additional task: after printing out the list of 25 top words, it should print out the number of non-stop words with the letter z. Additional constraints: (i) no changes should be made to the existing classes; adding new classes and more lines of code to the main function is allowed; (ii) files should be read only once for both term frequency and “words with z” tasks.
3. Words with z in other styles. Consider all the previous styles. For each of them, try to do the additional “words with z” task observing the constraints stated above. If you are able to do it, show the code; if not, explain why you think it can’t be done.
4. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using this style.
