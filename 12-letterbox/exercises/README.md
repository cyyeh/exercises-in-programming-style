# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Delegation. Let’s bring back the info methods of the Things style (previous chapter). Write a version of the program without using Python’s inheritance relations, but in a way that preserves those relations’ code reuse intention. That is, the info methods should be available to all classes when they receive the info message, but no procedures should be directly defined in any of the existing classes. Hint: Take inspiration from the Self programming language in using parent fields.
3. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using this style.
