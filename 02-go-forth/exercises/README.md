# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Search. In the example program, the comparison in line #78 is not in style, as it uses Pythonâ€™s high-level containment checking if x in y. Rewrite this piece of the program, i.e. searching whether a given word is in the dictionary on the heap, using go-forth style. Explain what happens to the performance of your program.
3. True stack. Python uses lists for implementing stacks, which makes the example program a bit confusing. Implement a true stack data structure in Python (possibly wrapping around a list) that provides the expected push, pop, peek and empty operations. Use your data structure in the example program, instead of the list introduced in line #7.
4. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using the go-forth style.
