# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Readlines. The example program reads one line at a time from the file. Modify it so that it first loads the entire file into memory (with readlines()), and then iterates over the lines in memory. Is this better or worse practice? Why?
3. Two loops. In lines #36–42 the example program potentially reorders, at every detected word, the list of word frequencies, so that it is always ordered by decreasing value of frequency. Within the monolithic style, modify the program so that the reordering is done in a separate loop at the end, before the word frequencies are printed out on the screen. What are the pros and cons of doing that?
4. Cyclomatic complexity. What is the cyclomatic complexity of the example program?
5. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using the monolithic style.”
