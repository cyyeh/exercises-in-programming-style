# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Forgotten methods. In the example program, the methods info are never invoked. Change the program (to the minimum) so that all of them are invoked, and their results are printed out. What happens internally when that method is invoked on the DataStorageManager object and on the WordFrequencyController object? Explain the results.
3. A different program. Write a different program, also in the Things style, that does exactly the same thing as the example program, but with different classes, i.e. using a different decomposition of the problem. No need to preserve the relatively artificial inheritance relations of the example, or the info methods.
4. Classless. Write a Things style implementation of the term frequency problem without using Pythonâ€™s classes. No need to preserve the info methods.
5. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using this style.
