# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Mismatch. What happens if the sorted method of WordFrequency-Manager is renamed to sorted_freqs, for example? Explain the result in detail.
3. Type checks. Use the decorator presented in this chapter in order to check the types of parameters passed to certain constructors and methods. Feel free to refactor the original example program in order to make type checking more meaningful. Turn in two versions of your new program, one that type checks and one that fails type checking.
4. A different bind. Quoting from the description of the example: “In this particular implementation, nothing in the classes associates them with the ABCs defined above. The association is done dynamically via the register method of the ABCs.” Do the association between ABCs and concrete implementations in a different way.
5. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using this style.
