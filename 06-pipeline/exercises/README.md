# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. 2 in 1. In the example program, the name of the file containing the list of stop words is hardcoded (line #36). Modify the program so that the name of the stop words file is given as the second argument in the command line. You must observe the following additional stylistic constraints: (1) no function can have more than 1 argument, and (2) the only function that can be changed is remove_stop_words; itâ€™s OK to change the call chain in the main block in order to reflect the changes in remove_stop_words.
3. A different program. Write a different program, also in the functional style, that does exactly the same thing as the example program, but with different functions.
4. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using the Pipeline style.
