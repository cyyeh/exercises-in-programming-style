# Exercises

1. Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.
2. Scope ’em. Modify the example program so that there are no global variables but the imperative style is still the dominant style and the procedures are essentially the same.
3. Double trouble. In the example program, which procedures are idempotent and which ones aren’t?
4. Details matter. Modify the example program as little as possible but make it so that all procedures become idempotent.
5. A different program. Write a different program, also in the Cookbook style, that does exactly the same thing as the example program but with different procedures.
6. A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using the Cookbook style.
