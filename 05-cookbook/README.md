Style #5
==============================

Constraints:

- No long jumps
- Complexity of control flow tamed by dividing the large problem into smaller units using procedural abstraction. Procedures are pieces of functionality that may take input, but that donâ€™t necessarily produce output that is relevant for the problem
- Procedures may share state in the form of global variables
- The larger problem is solved by applying the procedures, one after the other, that change, or add to, the shared state

Possible names:

- Cookbook
- Procedural
